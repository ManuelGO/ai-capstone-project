# Capstone Project - Professional Certificate in Machine Learning & AI

## Project Summary

This repository hosts the development of my capstone project as part of the Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence program.  
The project will focus on designing, implementing, and documenting an AI/ML algorithm or application that demonstrates practical skills and knowledge gained throughout the course.

## Goals

- Develop a fully documented AI/ML model or algorithm  
- Showcase the application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem  
- Build a portfolio-worthy artefact demonstrating both technical and professional skills  
- Integrate best practices in coding, testing, and documentation

## Key Tools and Libraries

- **Programming Languages:** Python, TypeScript  
- **ML Frameworks:**  PyTorch, scikit-learn  
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Web Frameworks (optional):** Angular, FastAPI, Flask  
- **Testing:** Pytest, Vitest, Cypress  
- **Version Control:** Git  
- **Others:** Jupyter Notebooks, Docker
